Project 2  For CSc 2310: Introduction to programming

This program tests the behavior of the Clock class. By instantiating a clock
the user has the ability to test every method of the clock class. The testing
class is called TestClass. The user will enter every input trough this testing
 class. The input will be verified and then evaluated. The class SimpleIO.java
from JAVA PROGRAMMING: FROM THE BEGINNING, by K. N. King has been used
to easily acquire user input.

The clock class stores time in hours, minutes, seconds format. By default all
the clock operations are done in 23 hour mode. It has also the ability to
toggle from 12 hour format to 24 hour format.

To execute the program in jvm by command line:
java -jar "{\folder path\}Project2.jar"

There are no parameters needed and none will be evaluated.
